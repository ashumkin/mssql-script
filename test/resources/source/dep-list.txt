# File format:
# <objectname>[:<substituted_object_type>]
#   <substituted_object_type> is used for UDF in Views
#   as objects are scripted in an order
#   "TAB", "VIW", "UDF", "PRC", "TRG"

# a2_Addition "depends on" b_Contractors
# this means b_Contractors must be created first
b_Contractors
a2_Addition
# this makes b_Contractors be the first in a list
# but b_ContractorsAddInfo depends on b_Contractors

# Views are scripted before functions
# but some views may depend on functions
# So, we can "substitute" type of a function
# to script it before a view that uses it
